                <li>Start by marinating the chicken in soy sauce and garlic. The garlic needs to be crushed for best results. This process takes 1 hour to 12 hours.</li>
                <li>Separate the chicken from the marinade</li>
                <li>Pan-fry the chicken pieces for 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side</li>
                <li>Pour marinade into the pot and add water. Let boil. The bay leaves and whole peppercorn can now be added. The process takes 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the vinegar. This can also be added as a part of the marinade. Let it cook for 10 minutes and then add sugar and salt.</li>
